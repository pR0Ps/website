Hello, I'm Carey.

I'm a software developer currently in my final year at [Queen's University][].

When I'm not studying, I spend my free time programming, reading, or spending time outdoors, usually on a bike.

I've done a lot of open source work, mostly on my own projects, but sometimes collaborating with other people and organizations.
To see a list of projects that I've worked on, check out my [GitHub Page][].

Occasionally, I feel the need to document my experiences. If you're interested in what I have to say, check out the [Blog][] section.

I'm currently employable! My résumé is availible [here][resume].

If you want to get in touch with me for any reason, feel free to use any of the links in the sidebar.
