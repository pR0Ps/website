Hi, I'm Carey.

I'm a software developer currently working in Ottawa.

When I'm not at work, I work on hobby projects, read, or spend time outdoors, usually on a bike.

I've done a lot of open source work, mostly on my own projects, but sometimes collaborating with other people and organizations.
To see a bunch of projects I've worked on, check out my [GitHub Page][].

Occasionally, I feel the need to document my experiences. If you're interested in what I have to say, check out the [Blog][] section.

If you want to get in touch with me for any reason, feel free to use any of the links in the sidebar.
