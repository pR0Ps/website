[SuperStudyBuddy][] is a site that two friends and I developed back
in 2008 in order to allow kids to play games on the web at school.
It circumvents the blocking filters that many schools use by disguising
itself as a study help site.

In order to access the games, go to the "Join" page, enter "abc" as your
name and click "Submit". We haven't touched it in a while (so the quality
is a little lacking), but who knows, we may revisit it.
