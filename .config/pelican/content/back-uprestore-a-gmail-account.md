[GMail Backup][] allows users to download all of their emails, as well
as the labels.

From there it's as simple as opening them up in a program like
[Outlook][] or [Thunderbird][] to view them. It also includes
an option to restore the emails.

Most email clients have the capability of doing this, but this was
by far the quickest way. Automatic incremental backups can also be
done by setting up a reoccurring task that uses the command-line
interface of the program.
