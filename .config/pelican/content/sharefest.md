[Sharefest][] is a site that allows users to send files of arbitrary size
via a P2P connection. To use it, go to the site, select a file to share,
then give the link to friend. All they have to do is visit the URL and
they'll be able to download the file you shared.

This transfer is directly from your computer to theirs, without the file
being uploaded anywhere between. This also makes it easy to stop sharing the
file. Just close the browser window and the file becomes inaccessable.

Sharefest is open-source! Check out the code on [GitHub][].
